### Expected LED Lifespan
Over time, use and heat will gradually reduce LED brightness. Clustered LEDs produce more heat than single LEDs,
contributing to shorter lifespans if always used at full intensity. The average LED lifespan is 40,000 to 50,000
hours. To extend LED lifespan, maintain proper ventilation around the product, and limit the overall intensity..

## Maintenance
### Product Maintenance
Dust build-up reduces light output performance and can cause overheating. This can lead to reduction of
the light source’s life and/or mechanical wear. To maintain optimum performance and minimize wear, clean
all lighting products at least twice a month. However, be aware that usage and environmental conditions
could be contributing factors to increase the cleaning frequency.
To clean the product, follow the instructions below:

1. Unplug the product from power.
2. Wait until the product is at room temperature.
3. Use a vacuum (or dry compressed air) and a soft brush to remove dust collected on the external
   surface/vents.
4. Clean all transparent surfaces with a mild soap solution, ammonia-free glass cleaner, or isopropyl
   alcohol.
5. Apply the solution directly to a soft, lint free cotton cloth or a lens cleaning tissue.
6. Softly drag any dirt or grime to the outside of the transparent surface.
7. Gently polish the transparent surfaces until they are free of haze and lint.

!!! info
    Always dry the transparent surfaces carefully after cleaning them.
